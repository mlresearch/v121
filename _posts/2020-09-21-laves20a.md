title: Well-Calibrated Regression Uncertainty in Medical Imaging with Deep Learning
abstract: 'The consideration of predictive uncertainty in medical imaging with deep
  learning is of utmost importance. We apply estimation of predictive uncertainty
  by variational Bayesian inference with Monte Carlo dropout to regression tasks and
  show why predictive uncertainty is systematically underestimated. We suggest using
  $ \sigma $ {\em scaling} with a single scalar value; a simple, yet effective calibration
  method for both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The performance of our approach
  is evaluated on a variety of common medical regression data sets using different
  state-of-the-art convolutional network architectures. In all experiments, $\sigma
  $ scaling is able to reliably recalibrate predictive uncertainty. It is easy to
  implement and maintains the accuracy. Well-calibrated uncertainty in regression
  allows robust rejection of unreliable predictions or detection of out-of-distribution
  samples. Our source code is available at: {https://github.com/mlaves/well-calibrated-regression-uncertainty}'
