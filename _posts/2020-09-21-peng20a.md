title: Towards multi-sequence MR image recovery from undersampled k-space data
abstract: Undersampled MR image recovery has been widely studied with Deep Learning
  methods as a post-processing step for accelerating MR acquisition. In this paper,
  we aim to optimize multi-sequence MR image recovery from undersampled k-space data
  under an overall time constraint. We first formulate it as a {\em constrained optimization}
  problem and show that finding the optimal sampling strategy for all sequences and
  the optimal recovery model for such sampling strategy is {\em combinatorial} and
  hence computationally prohibitive. To solve this problem, we propose a {\em blind
  recovery model} that simultaneously recovers multiple sequences, and an efficient
  approach to find proper combination of sampling strategy and recovery model. Our
  experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms sequence-wise recovery,
  and sheds light on how to decide the undersampling strategy for sequences within
  an overall time budget.
