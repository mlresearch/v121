title: 'Bounding boxes for weakly supervised segmentation: Global constraints get
  close to full supervision'
abstract: We propose a novel weakly supervised learning segmentation based on several
  global constraints derived from box annotations. Particularly, we leverage a classical
  tightness prior to a deep learning setting via imposing a set of constraints on
  the network outputs. Such a powerful topological prior prevents solutions from excessive
  shrinking by enforcing any horizontal or vertical line within the bounding box to
  contain, at least, one pixel of the foreground region. Furthermore, we integrate
  our deep tightness prior with a global background emptiness constraint, guiding
  training with information outside the bounding box. We demonstrate experimentally
  that such a global constraint is much more powerful than standard cross-entropy
  for the background class. Our optimization problem is challenging as it takes the
  form of a large set of inequality constraints on the outputs of deep networks. We
  solve it with sequence of unconstrained losses based on a recent powerful extension
  of the log-barrier method, which is well-known in the context of interior-point
  methods. This accommodates standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training
  deep networks, while avoiding computationally expensive and unstable Lagrangian
  dual steps and projections. Extensive experiments over two different public data
  sets and applications (prostate and brain lesions) demonstrate that the synergy
  between our global tightness and emptiness priors yield very competitive performances,
  approaching full supervision and outperforming significantly DeepCut. Furthermore,
  our approach removes the need for computationally expensive proposal generation.
  Our code is publicly available.
