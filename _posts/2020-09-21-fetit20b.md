title: 'Training deep segmentation networks on texture-encoded input: application
  to neuroimaging of the developing neonatal brain'
abstract: 'Standard practice for using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in semantic
  segmentation tasks assumes that the image intensities are directly used for training
  and inference. In natural images this is performed using RGB pixel intensities,
  whereas in medical imaging, e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), gray level pixel
  intensities are typically used. In this work, we explore the idea of encoding the
  image data as local binary textural maps prior to the feeding them to CNNs, and
  show that accurate segmentation models can be developed using such maps alone, without
  learning any representations from the images themselves. This questions common consensus
  that CNNs recognize objects from images by learning increasingly complex representations
  of shape, and suggests a more important role to image texture, in line with recent
  findings on natural images. We illustrate this for the first time on neuroimaging
  data of the developing neonatal brain in a tissue segmentation task, by analyzing
  large, publicly available T2-weighted MRI scans (n=558, range of postmenstrual ages
  at scan: 24.3 - 42.2 weeks) obtained retrospectively from the {\em Developing Human
  Connectome Project} cohort. Rapid changes in visual characteristics that take place
  during early brain development make it important to establish a clear understanding
  of the role of visual texture when training CNN models on neuroimaging data of the
  neonatal brain; this yet remains a largely understudied but important area of research.
  From a deep learning perspective, the results suggest that CNNs could simply be
  capable of learning representations from structured spatial information, and may
  not necessarily require conventional images as input.'
