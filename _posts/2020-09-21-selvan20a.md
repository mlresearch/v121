title: Tensor Networks for Medical Image Classification
abstract: 'With the increasing adoption of machine learning tools like neural networks
  across several domains, interesting connections and comparisons to concepts from
  other domains are coming to light. In this work, we focus on the class of Tensor
  Networks, which has been a work horse for physicists in the last two decades to
  analyse quantum many-body systems. Building on the recent interest in tensor networks
  for machine learning, we extend the Matrix Product State tensor networks (which
  can be interpreted as linear classifiers operating in exponentially high dimensional
  spaces) to be useful in medical image analysis tasks. We focus on classification
  problems as a first step where we motivate the use of tensor networks and propose
  adaptions for 2D images using classical image domain concepts such as local orderlessness
  of images. With the proposed locally orderless tensor network model (Official repository:
  {https://github.com/raghavian/loTeNet_pytorch/}), we show that tensor networks are
  capable of attaining performance that is comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning
  methods. We evaluate the model on two publicly available medical imaging datasets
  and show performance improvements with fewer model hyperparameters and lesser computational
  resources compared to relevant baseline methods.'
