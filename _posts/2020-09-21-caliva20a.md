title: Breaking Speed Limits with Simultaneous Ultra-Fast MRI Reconstruction and Tissue
  Segmentation
abstract: Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) acquisition, reconstruction and tissue segmentation
  are usually considered separate problems. This can be limiting when it comes to
  rapidly extracting relevant clinical parameters. In many applications, availability
  of reconstructed images with high fidelity may not be a priority as long as biomarker
  extraction is reliable and feasible. Built upon this concept, we demonstrate that
  it is possible to perform tissue segmentation directly from highly undersampled
  \textit{k-}space and obtain quality results comparable to those in fully-sampled
  scenarios. We propose {\em TB-recon}, a 3D task-based reconstruction framework.
  {\em TB-recon} simultaneously reconstructs MRIs from raw data and segments tissues
  of interest. To do so, we devised a network architecture with a shared encoding
  path and two task-related decoders where features flow among tasks. We deployed
  {\em TB-recon} on a set of (up to $24\times$) retrospectively undersampled MRIs
  from the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset, where we automatically segmented knee
  cartilage and menisci. An experimental study was conducted showing the superior
  performance of the proposed method over a combination of a standard MRI reconstruction
  and segmentation method, as well as alternative deep learning based solutions. In
  addition, our ablation study highlighted the importance of skip connections among
  the decoders for the segmentation task. Ultimately, we conducted a reader study,
  where two musculoskeletal radiologists assessed the proposed model�s reconstruction
  performance.
