title: Laplacian pyramid-based complex neural network learning for fast MR imaging
abstract: 'A Laplacian pyramid-based complex neural network, CLP-Net, is proposed
  to reconstruct high-quality magnetic resonance images from undersampled k-space
  data. Specifically, three major contributions have been made: 1) A new framework
  has been proposed to explore the encouraging multi-scale properties of Laplacian
  pyramid decomposition; 2) A cascaded multi-scale network architecture with complex
  convolutions has been designed under the proposed framework; 3) Experimental validations
  on an open source dataset fastMRI demonstrate the encouraging properties of the
  proposed method in preserving image edges and fine textures.'
