title: A deep learning approach to segmentation of the developing cortex in fetal
  brain MRI with minimal manual labeling
abstract: 'We developed an automated system based on deep neural networks for fast
  and sensitive 3D image segmentation of cortical gray matter from fetal brain MRI.
  The lack of extensive/publicly available annotations presented a key challenge,
  as large amounts of labeled data are typically required for training sensitive models
  with deep learning. To address this, we: (i) generated preliminary tissue labels
  using the {\em Draw-EM} algorithm, which uses Expectation-Maximization and was originally
  designed for tissue segmentation in the neonatal domain; and (ii) employed a human-in-the-loop
  approach, whereby an expert fetal imaging annotator assessed and refined the performance
  of the model. By using a hybrid approach that combined automatically generated labels
  with manual refinements by an expert, we amplified the utility of ground truth annotations
  while immensely reducing their cost (283 slices). The deep learning system was developed,
  refined, and validated on 249 3D T2-weighted scans obtained from the {\em Developing
  Human Connectome Project}’s fetal cohort, acquired at 3T. Analysis of the system
  showed that it is invariant to gestational age at scan, as it generalized well to
  a wide age range (21 � 38 weeks) despite variations in cortical morphology and intensity
  across the fetal distribution. It was also found to be invariant to intensities
  in regions surrounding the brain (amniotic fluid), which often present a major obstacle
  to the processing of neuroimaging data in the fetal domain.'
