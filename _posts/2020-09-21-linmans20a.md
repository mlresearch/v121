title: Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection in Digital Pathology Using Multi-Head
  Convolutional Neural Networks
abstract: Successful clinical implementation of deep learning in medical imaging depends,
  in part, on the reliability of the predictions. Specifically, the system should
  be accurate for classes seen during training while providing calibrated estimates
  of uncertainty for abnormalities and unseen classes. To efficiently estimate predictive
  uncertainty, we propose the use of multi-head CNNs (M-heads). We compare its performance
  to related and more prevalent approaches, such as deep ensembles, on the task of
  out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. To this end, we evaluate models trained to
  discriminate normal lymph node tissue from breast cancer metastases, on lymph nodes
  containing lymphoma. We show the ability to discriminate between in-distribution
  lymph node tissue and lymphoma by evaluating the AUROC based on the uncertainty
  signal. Here, the best performing multi-head CNN (91.7) outperforms both Monte Carlo
  dropout (88.3) and deep ensembles (86.8). Furthermore, we show that the meta-loss
  function of M-heads improves OOD detection in terms of AUROC.
