title: Brain Metastasis Segmentation Network Trained with Robustness to Annotations
  with Multiple False Negatives
abstract: Deep learning has proven to be an essential tool for medical image analysis.
  However, the need for accurately labeled input data, often requiring time- and labor-intensive
  annotation by experts, is a major limitation to the use of deep learning. One solution
  to this challenge is to allow for use of coarse or noisy labels, which could permit
  more efficient and scalable labeling of images. In this work, we develop a lopsided
  loss function based on entropy regularization that assumes the existence of a nontrivial
  false negative rate in the target annotations. Starting with a carefully annotated
  brain metastasis lesion dataset, we simulate data with false negatives by (1) randomly
  censoring the annotated lesions and (2) systematically censoring the smallest lesions.
  The latter better models true physician error because smaller lesions are harder
  to notice than the larger ones. Even with a simulated false negative rate as high
  as $50%$, applying our loss function to randomly censored data preserves maximum
  sensitivity at $97%$ of the baseline with uncensored training data, compared to
  just $10%$ for a standard loss function. For the size-based censorship, performance
  is restored from $17%$ with the current standard to $88%$ with our lopsided bootstrap
  loss. Our work will enable more efficient scaling of the image labeling process,
  in parallel with other approaches on creating more efficient user interfaces and
  tools for annotation.
