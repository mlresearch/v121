title: Fast Mitochondria Detection for Connectomics
abstract: High-resolution connectomics data allows for the identification of dysfunctional
  mitochondria which are linked to a variety of diseases such as autism or bipolar.
  However, manual analysis is not feasible since datasets can be petabytes in size.
  We present a fully automatic mitochondria detector based on a modified U-Net architecture
  that yields high accuracy and fast processing times. We evaluate our method on multiple
  real-world connectomics datasets, including an improved version of the EPFL mitochondria
  benchmark. Our results show an Jaccard index of up to 0.90 with inference times
  lower than 16ms for a $512\times512$px image tile. This speed is faster than the
  acquisition speed of modern electron microscopes, enabling mitochondria detection
  in real-time. Our detector ranks first for real-time detection when compared to
  previous works and data, results, and code are openly available.
