title: 'Skull R-CNN: A CNN-based network for the skull fracture detection'
abstract: Skull fractures, following head trauma, may bring several complications
  and cause epidural hematomas. Therefore, it is of great significance to locate the
  fracture in time. However, the manual detection is time-consuming and laborious,
  and the previous studies for the automatic detection could not achieve the accuracy
  and robustness for clinical application. In this work, based on the Faster R-CNN,
  we propose a novel method for more accurate skull fracture detection results, and
  we name it as the Skull R-CNN. Guiding by the morphological features of the skull,
  a skeleton-based region proposal method is proposed to make candidate boxes more
  concentrated in key regions and reduced invalid boxes. With this advantage, the
  region proposal network in Faster R-CNN is removed for less computation. On the
  other hand, a novel full resolution feature network is constructed to obtain more
  precise features to make the model more sensitive to small objects. Experiment results
  showed that most of skull fractures could be detected correctly by the proposed
  method in a short time. Compared to the previous works on the skull fracture detection,
  Skull R-CNN significantly reduces the false positives, and keeps a high sensitivity.
