title: 'SAU-Net: Efficient 3D Spine MRI Segmentation Using Inter-Slice Attention'
abstract: Accurate segmentation of spine Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly
  demanded in morphological research, quantitative analysis, and diseases identification,
  such as spinal canal stenosis, disc herniation and degeneration. However, accurate
  spine segmentation is challenging because of the irregular shape, artifacts and
  large variability between slices. To alleviate these problems, spatial information
  is used for more continuous and accurate segmentation such as by 3D convolutional
  neural networks (CNN) . However, 3D CNN suffers from higher computational cost,
  memory cost and risk of over-fitting, especially for medical images where the number
  of labeled data is limited. To address these problems, we apply the attention mechanism
  for the utilization of inter-slice information in 3D segmentation tasks based on
  2D convolutional networks and propose a spatial attention-based densely connected
  U-Net (SAU-Net), which consists of Dense U-Net for extraction of intra-slice features
  and an inter-slice attention module (ISA) to utilize inter-slice information from
  adjacent slices and refine the segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate
  the effectiveness of ISA as well as higher accuracy and efficiency of segmentation
  results of our method compared with other deep learning methods.
