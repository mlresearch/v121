title: On Direct Distribution Matching for Adapting Segmentation Networks
abstract: Minimization of distribution matching losses is a principled approach to
  domain adaptation in the context of image classification. However, it is largely
  overlooked in adapting segmentation networks, which is currently dominated by adversarial
  models. We propose a class of loss functions, which encourage direct kernel density
  matching in the network-output space, up to some geometric transformations computed
  from unlabeled inputs. Rather than using an intermediate domain discriminator, our
  direct approach unifies distribution matching and segmentation in a single loss.
  Therefore, it simplifies segmentation adaptation by avoiding extra adversarial steps,
  while improving quality, stability and efficiency of training. We juxtapose our
  approach to state-of-the-art segmentation adaptation via adversarial training in
  the network-output space. In the challenging task of adapting brain segmentation
  across different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities, our approach achieves
  significantly better results both in terms of accuracy and stability.
