title: Mutual information deep regularization for semi-supervised segmentation
abstract: The scarcity of labeled data often limits the application of deep learning
  to medical image segmentation. Semi-supervised learning helps overcome this limitation
  by leveraging unlabeled images to guide the learning process. In this paper, we
  propose using a clustering loss based on mutual information that explicitly enforces
  prediction consistency between nearby pixels in unlabeled images, and for random
  perturbation of these images, while imposing the network to predict the correct
  labels for annotated images. Since mutual information does not require a strict
  ordering of clusters in two different cluster assignments, we propose to incorporate
  another consistency regularization loss which forces the alignment of class probabilities
  at each pixel of perturbed unlabeled images. We evaluate the method on three challenging
  publicly-available medical datasets for image segmentation. Experimental results
  show our method to outperform recently-proposed approaches for semi-supervised and
  yield a performance comparable to fully-supervised training.
