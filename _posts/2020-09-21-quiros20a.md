title: 'PathologyGAN: Learning deep representations of cancer tissue'
abstract: We apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the domain of digital
  pathology. Current machine learning research for digital pathology focuses on diagnosis,
  but we suggest a different approach and advocate that generative models could drive
  forward the understanding of morphological characteristics of cancer tissue. In
  this paper, we develop a framework which allows GANs to capture key tissue features
  and uses these characteristics to give structure to its latent space. To this end,
  we trained our model on $249$K H$&$E breast cancer tissue images, extracted from
  576 TMA images of patients from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) and Vancouver
  General Hospital (VGH) cohorts. We show that our model generates high quality images,
  with a Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) of 16.65. We further assess the quality
  of the images with cancer tissue characteristics (e.g. count of cancer, lymphocytes,
  or stromal cells), using quantitative information to calculate the FID and showing
  consistent performance of 9.86. Additionally, the latent space of our model shows
  an interpretable structure and allows semantic vector operations that translate
  into tissue feature transformations. Furthermore, ratings from two expert pathologists
  found no significant difference between our generated tissue images from real ones.
