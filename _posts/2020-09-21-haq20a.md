title: Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Cell Segmentation
abstract: To successfully train a cell segmentation network in fully-supervised manner
  for a particular type of organ or cancer, we need the dataset with ground-truth
  annotations. However, high unavailability of such annotated dataset and tedious
  labeling process enforce us to discover a way for training with unlabeled dataset.
  In this paper, we propose a network named CellSegUDA for cell segmentation on the
  unlabeled dataset (target domain). It is achieved by applying unsupervised domain
  adaptation (UDA) technique with the help of another labeled dataset (source domain)
  that may come from other organs or sources. We validate our proposed CellSegUDA
  on two public cell segmentation datasets and obtain significant improvement as compared
  with the baseline methods. Finally, considering the scenario when we have a small
  number of annotations available from the target domain, we extend our work to CellSegSSDA,
  a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) based approach. Our SSDA model also gives
  excellent results which are quite close to the fully-supervised upper bound in target
  domain.
