title: Automated Labelling using an Attention model for Radiology reports of MRI scans
  (ALARM)
abstract: Labelling large datasets for training high-capacity neural networks is a
  major obstacle to the development of deep learning-based medical imaging applications.
  Here we present a transformer-based network for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
  radiology report classification which automates this task by assigning image labels
  on the basis of free-text expert radiology reports. Our modelï¿½s performance is comparable
  to that of an expert radiologist, and better than that of an expert physician, demonstrating
  the feasibility of this approach. We make our code available for researchers to
  label their own MRI datasets for medical imaging applications.
