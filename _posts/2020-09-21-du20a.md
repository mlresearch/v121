title: '3D-RADNet: Extracting labels from DICOM metadata for training general medical
  domain deep 3D convolution neural networks'
abstract: Training deep convolution neural network requires a large amount of data
  to obtain good performance and generalisable results. Transfer learning approaches
  from datasets such as ImageNet had become important in increasing accuracy and lowering
  training samples required. However, as of now, there has not been a popular dataset
  for training 3D volumetric medical images. This is mainly due to the time and expert
  knowledge required to accurately annotate medical images. In this study, we present
  a method in extracting labels from DICOM metadata that information on the appearance
  of the scans to train a medical domain 3D convolution neural network. The labels
  include imaging modalities and sequences, patient orientation and view, presence
  of contrast agent, scan target and coverage, and slice spacing. We applied our method
  and extracted labels from a large amount of cancer imaging dataset from TCIA to
  train a medical domain 3D deep convolution neural network. We evaluated the effectiveness
  of using our proposed network in transfer learning a liver segmentation task and
  found that our network achieved superior segmentation performance (DICE=$90.0%$)
  compared to training from scratch (DICE=$41.8%$). Our proposed network shows promising
  results to be used as a backbone network for transfer learning to another task.
  Our approach along with the utilising our network, can potentially be used to extract
  features from large-scale unlabelled DICOM datasets.
