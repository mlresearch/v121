title: Knee Injury Detection using MRI with Efficiently-Layered Network (ELNet)
abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely-accepted imaging technique
  for knee injury analysis. Its advantage of capturing knee structure in three dimensions
  makes it the ideal tool for radiologists to locate potential tears in the knee.
  In order to better confront the ever growing workload of musculoskeletal (MSK) radiologists,
  automated tools for patients’ triage are becoming a real need, reducing delays in
  the reading of pathological cases. In this work, we present the Efficiently-Layered
  Network (ELNet), a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for
  the task of initial knee MRI diagnosis for triage. Unlike past approaches, we train
  ELNet from scratch instead of using a transfer-learning approach. The proposed method
  is validated quantitatively and qualitatively, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art
  MRNet while using a single imaging stack (axial or coronal) as input. Additionally,
  we demonstrate our model’s capability to locate tears in the knee despite the absence
  of localization information during training. Lastly, the proposed model is extremely
  lightweight ($<$ 1MB) and therefore easy to train and deploy in real clinical settings.
