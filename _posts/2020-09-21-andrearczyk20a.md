title: Automatic Segmentation of Head and Neck Tumors and Nodal Metastases in PET-CT
  scans
abstract: Radiomics, the prediction of disease characteristics using quantitative
  image biomarkers from medical images, relies on expensive manual annotations of
  Regions of Interest (ROI) to focus the analysis. In this paper, we propose an automatic
  segmentation of Head and Neck (H$&$N) tumors and nodal metastases from FDG-PET and
  CT images. A fully-convolutional network (2D and 3D V-Net) is trained on PET-CT
  images using ground truth ROIs that were manually delineated by radiation oncologists
  for 202 patients. The results show the complementarity of the two modalities with
  a statistically significant improvement from 48.7$%$ and 58.2$%$ Dice Score Coefficients
  (DSC) with CT- and PET-only segmentation respectively, to 60.6$%$ with a bimodal
  late fusion approach. We also note that, on this task, a 2D implementation slightly
  outperforms a similar 3D design (60.6$%$ vs 59.7$%$ for the best results respectively).
