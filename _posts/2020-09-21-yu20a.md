title: An Auto-Encoder Strategy for Adaptive Image Segmentation
abstract: 'Deep neural networks are powerful tools for biomedical image segmentation.
  These models are often trained with heavy supervision, relying on pairs of images
  and corresponding voxel-level labels. However, obtaining segmentations of anatomical
  regions on a large number of cases can be prohibitively expensive. Thus there is
  a strong need for deep learning-based segmentation tools that do not require heavy
  supervision and can continuously adapt. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective
  of segmentation as a discrete representation learning problem, and present a variational
  autoencoder segmentation strategy that is flexible and adaptive. Our method, called
  Segmentation Auto-Encoder (SAE), leverages all available unlabeled scans and merely
  requires a segmentation prior, which can be \textit{a single unpaired} segmentation
  image. In experiments, we apply SAE to brain MRI scans. Our results show that SAE
  can produce good quality segmentations, particularly when the prior is good. We
  demonstrate that a Markov Random Field prior can yield significantly better results
  than a spatially independent prior. Our code is freely available at: {https://github.com/evanmy/sae}.'
