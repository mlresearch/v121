title: 'Correlation via Synthesis: End-to-end Image Generation and Radiogenomic Learning
  Based on Generative Adversarial Network'
abstract: 'Radiogenomic map linking image features and gene expression profiles has
  great potential for non-invasively identifying molecular properties of a particular
  type of disease. Conventionally, such map is produced in three independent steps:
  1) gene-clustering to metagenes, 2) image feature extraction, and 3) statistical
  correlation between metagenes and image features. Each step is separately performed
  and relies on arbitrary measurements without considering the correlation among each
  other. In this work, we investigate the potential of an end-to-end method fusing
  gene code with image features to generate synthetic pathology image and learn radiogenomic
  map simultaneously. To achieve this goal, we develop a multi-conditional generative
  adversarial network (GAN) conditioned on both background images and gene expression
  code, synthesizing the corresponding image. Image and gene features are fused at
  different scales to ensure both the separation of pathology part and background,
  as well as the realism and quality of the synthesized image. We tested our method
  on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed
  method produces realistic synthetic images, and provides a promising way to find
  gene-image relationship in a holistic end-to-end manner.'
