title: Direct estimation of fetal head circumference from ultrasound images based
  on regression CNN
abstract: The measurement of fetal head circumference (HC) is performed throughout
  the pregnancy as a key biometric to monitor fetus growth. This measurement is performed
  on ultrasound images, via the manual fitting of an ellipse. The operation is operator-dependent
  and as such prone to intra and inter-variability error. There have been attempts
  to design automated segmentation algorithms to segment fetal head, especially based
  on deep encoding-decoding architectures. In this paper, we depart from this idea
  and propose to leverage the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to directly
  measure the head circumference, without having to resort to handcrafted features
  or manually labeled segmented images. The intuition behind this idea is that the
  CNN will learn itself to localize and identify the head contour. Our approach is
  experimented on the public HC18 dataset, that contains images of all trimesters
  of the pregnancy. We investigate various architectures and three losses suitable
  for regression. While room for improvement is left, encouraging results show that
  it might be possible in the future to directly estimate the HC - without the need
  for a large dataset of manually segmented ultrasound images. This approach might
  be extended to other applications where segmentation is just an intermediate step
  to the computation of biomarkers.
