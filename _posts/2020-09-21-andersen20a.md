title: Comparing Objective Functions for Segmentation and Detection of Microaneurysms
  in Retinal Images
abstract: 'Retinal microaneurysms (MAs) are the earliest signs of diabetic retinopathy
  (DR) which is the leading cause of blindness among the working aged population in
  the western world. Detection of MAs present a particular challenge as MA pixels
  account for less than 0.5$%$ of the retinal image. In deep neural networks the learning
  process can be adversely affected by imbalance which introduces a bias towards the
  most well represented class. Recently, a number of objective functions have been
  proposed as alternatives to the standard Crossentropy (CE) loss in efforts to combat
  this problem. In this work we investigate the influence of the network objective
  during optimization by comparing Residual U-nets trained for segmentation of MAs
  in retinal images using six different objective functions; weighted and unweighted
  CE, Dice loss, weighted and unweighted Focal loss and Focal Tversky loss. We also
  perform test with the CE objective using a more complex model. Three networks with
  different seeds are trained for each objective function using optimized hyper-parameter
  settings on a dataset of 382 images with pixel level annotations for MAs. Instance
  level MA detection performance is evaluated with the average free response receiver
  operator characteristic (FROC) score calculated as the mean sensitivity at seven
  average false positives per image thresholds on 80 test images. The image level
  MA detection performance and detection of low levels of DR is evaluated with bootstrapped
  AUC scores on the same images and a separate test set of 1287 images. Significance
  test for image level detection accuracy ($\alpha$ = 0.05) is performed using Cochran’s
  Q and McNemar’s test. Segmentation performance is evaluated with the average pixel
  precision (AP) score. For instance level detection and pixel segmentation we perform
  repeated measures ANOVA with Post-Hoc tests. Results: Losses based on the CE index
  perform significantly better than the Dice and Focal Tversky loss for instance level
  detection and pixel segmentation. The highest FROC score of 0.5448 ($\pm$0.0096)
  and AP of 0.4888 ($\pm$0.0196) is achieved using weighted CE. For all objectives
  excluding the Focal Tversky loss (AUC = 0.5) there is no significant difference
  for image level detection accuracy on the 80 image test set. The highest AUC of
  0.993 (95$%$ CI: 0.980 - 1.0) is achieved using the Focal loss. For detection of
  mild DR on the set of 1287 images there is a significant difference between model
  objectives $(p = 2.87e^{-12})$. An AUC of 0.730 (95$%$ CI: 0.683 - 0.745 is achieved
  using the complex model with CE. Using the Focal Tversky objective we fail to detect
  any MAs on both instance and image level. Conclusion: Our results suggest that it
  is important to benchmark new losses against the CE and Focal loss functions, as
  we achieve similar or better results in our test using these objectives.'
