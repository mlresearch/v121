title: A Learning Strategy for Contrast-agnostic MRI Segmentation
abstract: 'We present a deep learning strategy for contrast-agnostic semantic segmentation
  of unpreprocessed brain MRI scans, without requiring additional training or fine-tuning
  for new modalities. Classical Bayesian methods address this segmentation problem
  with unsupervised intensity models, but require significant computational resources.
  In contrast, learning-based methods can be fast at test time, but are sensitive
  to the data available at training. Our proposed learning method, SynthSeg, leverages
  a set of training segmentations (no intensity images required) to generate synthetic
  scans of widely varying contrasts on the fly during training. These scans are produced
  using the generative model of the classical Bayesian segmentation framework, with
  randomly sampled parameters for appearance, deformation, noise, and bias field.
  Because each mini-batch has a different synthetic contrast, the final network is
  not biased towards any specific MRI contrast. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
  on four datasets comprising over 1,000 subjects and four MR contrasts. The results
  show that our approach successfully segments every contrast in the data, performing
  slightly better than classical Bayesian segmentation, and three orders of magnitude
  faster. Moreover, even within the same type of MRI contrast, our strategy generalizes
  significantly better across datasets, compared to training using real images. Finally,
  we find that synthesizing a broad range of contrasts, even if unrealistic, increases
  the generalization of the neural network. Our code and model are open source at:
