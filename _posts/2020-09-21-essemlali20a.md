title: Understanding Alzheimer disease’s structural connectivity through explainable
  AI
abstract: In the following work, we use a modified version of deep BrainNet convolutional
  neural network (CNN) trained on the diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) tractography
  connectomes of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment
  (MCI) to better understand the structural connectomics of that disease. We show
  that with a relatively simple connectomic BrainNetCNN used to classify brain images
  and explainable AI techniques, one can underline brain regions and their connectivity
  involved in AD. Results reveal that the connected regions with high structural differences
  between groups are those also reported in previous AD literature. Our findings support
  that deep learning over structural connectomes is a powerful tool to leverage the
  complex structure within connectomes derived from diffusion MRI tractography. To
  our knowledge, our contribution is the first explainable AI work applied to structural
  analysis of a degenerative disease.
