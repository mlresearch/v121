title: Feature Disentanglement to Aid Imaging Biomarker Characterization for Genetic
  Mutations
abstract: 'Various mutations have been shown to correlate with prognosis of High-Grade
  Glioma (Glioblastoma). Overall prognostic assessment requires analysis of multiple
  modalities: imaging, molecular and clinical. To optimize this assessment pipeline,
  this paper develops the first deep learning-based system that uses MRI data to predict
  19/20 co-gain, a mutation that indicates median survival. It addresses two key challenges
  when dealing with deep learning algorithms and medical data: lack of data and high
  data imbalance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a unified approach that consists
  of a Feature Disentanglement based Generative Adversarial Network (FeaD-GAN) for
  generating synthetic images. FeaD-GAN projects disentangled features into a high
  dimensional space and re-samples them from a pseudo-large data distribution to generate
  synthetic images from very limited data. A thorough analysis is performed to (a)
  characterize aspects of visual manifestation of 19/20 co-gain to demonstrate the
  effectiveness of FeaD-GAN and (b) demonstrate that not only do the imaging biomarkers
  of 19/20 co-gain exist, but also that they are reproducible.'
