title: A Cross-Stitch Architecture for Joint Registration and Segmentation in Adaptive
  Radiotherapy
abstract: Recently, joint registration and segmentation has been formulated in a deep
  learning setting, by the definition of joint loss functions. In this work, we investigate
  joining these tasks at the architectural level. We propose a registration network
  that integrates segmentation propagation between images, and a segmentation network
  to predict the segmentation directly. These networks are connected into a single
  joint architecture via so-called cross-stitch units, allowing information to be
  exchanged between the tasks in a learnable manner. The proposed method is evaluated
  in the context of adaptive image-guided radiotherapy, using daily prostate CT imaging.
  Two datasets from different institutes and manufacturers were involved in the study.
  The first dataset was used for training (12 patients) and validation (6 patients),
  while the second dataset was used as an independent test set (14 patients). In terms
  of mean surface distance, our approach achieved $1.06 \pm 0.3$ mm, $0.91 \pm 0.4$
  mm, $1.27 \pm 0.4$ mm, and $1.76 \pm 0.8$ mm on the validation set and $1.82 \pm
  2.4$ mm, $2.45 \pm 2.4$ mm, $2.45 \pm 5.0$ mm, and $2.57 \pm 2.3$ mm on the test
  set for the prostate, bladder, seminal vesicles, and rectum, respectively. The proposed
  multi-task network outperformed single-task networks, as well as a network only
  joined through the loss function, thus demonstrating the capability to leverage
  the individual strengths of the segmentation and registration tasks. The obtained
  performance as well as the inference speed make this a promising candidate for daily
  re-contouring in adaptive radiotherapy, potentially reducing treatment-related side
  effects and improving quality-of-life after treatment.
