title: End-to-end learning of convolutional neural net and dynamic programming for
  left ventricle segmentation
abstract: Differentiable programming is able to combine different functions or modules
  in a data processing pipeline with the goal of applying gradient descent-based end-to-end
  learning or optimization. A significant impediment to differentiable programming
  is the non-differentiable nature of some functions. We propose to overcome this
  difficulty by using neural networks to approximate such modules. An approximating
  neural network provides synthetic gradients (SG) for backpropagation across a non-differentiable
  module. Our design is grounded on a well-known theory that gradient of an approximating
  neural network can approximate a sub-gradient of a weakly differentiable function.
  We apply SG to combine convolutional neural network (CNN) with dynamic programming
  (DP) in end-to-end learning for segmenting left ventricle from short axis view of
  heart MRI. Our experiments show that end-to-end combination of CNN and DP requires
  fewer labeled images to achieve a significantly better segmentation accuracy than
  using only CNN.
