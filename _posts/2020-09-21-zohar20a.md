title: Accurate Detection of Out of Body Segments in Surgical Video using Semi-Supervised
  Learning
abstract: Large labeled datasets are an important precondition for deep learning models
  to achieve state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. In the medical imaging
  domain, privacy concerns have limited the rate of adoption of artificial intelligence
  methodologies into clinical practice. To alleviate such concerns, and increase comfort
  levels while sharing and storing surgical video data, we propose a high accuracy
  method for rapid removal and anonymization of out-of-body and non-relevant surgery
  segments. Training a deep model to detect out-of-body and non-relevant segments
  in surgical videos requires suitable labeling. Since annotating surgical videos
  with per-second relevancy labeling is a tedious task, our proposed framework initiates
  the learning process from a weakly labeled noisy dataset and iteratively applies
  Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) to re-annotate the training data samples. Evaluating
  our model, on an independent test set, shows a mean detection accuracy of above
  $97%$ after several training-annotating iterations. Since our final goal is achieving
  out-of-body segments detection for anonymization, we evaluate our ability to detect
  these segments at a high demanding recall of $97%$, which leads to a precision of
  $83.5%$. We believe this approach can be applied to similar related medical problems,
  in which only a coarse set of relevancy labels exists, currently limiting the possibility
  for supervision training.
