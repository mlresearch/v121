title: Siamese Content Loss Networks for Highly Imbalanced Medical Image Segmentation
abstract: Automatic segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) remains highly sought after due to the potential to streamline
  and alleviate clinical workflows. WMHs are small relative to whole acquired volume,
  which leads to class imbalance issues, and instability during the training process
  of many deep learning based solutions. To address this, we propose a method which
  is robust to effects of class imbalance, through incorporating multi-scale information
  in the training process. Our method consists of training an encoder-decoder neural
  network utilizing a Siamese network as an auxiliary loss function. These Siamese
  networks take in pairs of image pairs, input images masked with ground truth labels,
  and input images masked with predictions, and computes multi-resolution feature
  vector representations and provides gradient feedback in the form of a L2 norm.
  We leverage transfer learning in our Siamese network, and present positive results
  without need to further train. It was found these methods are more robust for training
  segmentation neural networks and provide greater generalizability. Our method was
  cross-validated on multi-center data, yielding significant overall agreement with
  manual annotations.
