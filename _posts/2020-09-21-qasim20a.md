title: 'Red-GAN: Attacking class imbalance via conditioned generation. Yet another
  medical imaging perspective.'
abstract: 'Exploiting learning algorithms under scarce data regimes is a limitation
  and a reality of the medical imaging field. In an attempt to mitigate the problem,
  we propose a data augmentation protocol based on generative adversarial networks.
  We condition the networks at a pixel-level (segmentation mask) and at a global-level
  information (acquisition environment or lesion type). Such conditioning provides
  immediate access to the image-label pairs while controlling global class specific
  appearance of the synthesized images. To stimulate synthesis of the features relevant
  for the segmentation task, an additional passive player in a form of segmentor is
  introduced into the the adversarial game. We validate the approach on two medical
  datasets: BraTS, ISIC. By controlling the class distribution through injection of
  synthetic images into the training set we achieve control over the accuracy levels
  of the datasetsâ€™ classes. The code is available at https://github.com/IvanEz/Red-GAN.'
