title: 'KD-MRI: A knowledge distillation framework for image reconstruction and image
  restoration in MRI workflow'
abstract: Deep learning networks are being developed in every stage of the MRI workflow
  and have provided state-of-the-art results. However, this has come at the cost of
  increased computation requirement and storage. Hence, replacing the networks with
  compact models at various stages in the MRI workflow can significantly reduce the
  required storage space and provide considerable speedup. In computer vision, knowledge
  distillation is a commonly used method for model compression. In our work, we propose
  a knowledge distillation (KD) framework for the image to image problems in the MRI
  workflow in order to develop compact, low-parameter models without a significant
  drop in performance. We propose a combination of the attention-based feature distillation
  method and imitation loss and demonstrate its effectiveness on the popular MRI reconstruction
  architecture, DC-CNN. We conduct extensive experiments using Cardiac, Brain, and
  Knee MRI datasets for 4x, 5x and 8x accelerations. We observed that the student
  network trained with the assistance of the teacher using our proposed KD framework
  provided significant improvement over the student network trained without assistance
  across all the datasets and acceleration factors. Specifically, for the Knee dataset,
  the student network achieves $65%$ parameter reduction, 2x faster CPU running time,
  and 1.5x faster GPU running time compared to the teacher. Furthermore, we compare
  our attention-based feature distillation method with other feature distillation
  methods. We also conduct an ablative study to understand the significance of attention-based
  distillation and imitation loss. We also extend our KD framework for MRI super-resolution
  and show encouraging results.
