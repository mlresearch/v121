title: Cascade Dual-branch Deep Neural Networks for Retinal Layer and fluid Segmentation
  of Optical Coherence Tomography Incorporating Relative Positional Map
abstract: 'Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technology
  that can provide micrometer-resolution cross-sectional images of the inner structures
  of the eye. It is widely used for the diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases with retinal
  alteration such as layer deformation and fluid accumulation. In this paper, a novel
  framework was proposed to segment retinal layers with fluid presence. The main contribution
  of this study is two folds: 1) we developed a cascaded network framework to incorporate
  the prior structural knowledge; 2) we proposed a novel two-path deep neural network
  which includes both the U-Net architecture as well as the original implementation
  of the fully convolutional network, concatenated into a final multi-level dilated
  layer to achieve accurate simultaneous layer and fluid segmentation. Cross validation
  experiments proved that the proposed network has superior performance comparing
  with the state-of-the-art methods by up to $3%$, and incorporating the relative
  positional map structural prior information could further improve the performance
  (up to $1%$) regardless of the network.'
