title: An Auxiliary Task for Learning Nuclei Segmentation in 3D Microscopy Images
abstract: Segmentation of cell nuclei in microscopy images is a prevalent necessity
  in cell biology. Especially for three-dimensional datasets, manual segmentation
  is prohibitively time-consuming, motivating the need for automated methods. Learning-based
  methods trained on pixel-wise ground-truth segmentations have been shown to yield
  state-of-the-art results on 2d benchmark image data of nuclei, yet a respective
  benchmark is missing for 3d image data. In this work, we perform a comparative evaluation
  of nuclei segmentation algorithms on a database of manually segmented 3d light microscopy
  volumes. We propose a novel learning strategy that boosts segmentation accuracy
  by means of a simple auxiliary task, thereby robustly outperforming each of our
  baselines. Furthermore, we show that one of our baselines, the popular three-label
  model, when trained with our proposed auxiliary task, outperforms the recent {\em
  StarDist-3D}. As an additional, practical contribution, we benchmark nuclei segmentation
  against nuclei {\em detection}, i.e. the task of merely pinpointing individual nuclei
  without generating respective pixel-accurate segmentations. For learning nuclei
  detection, large 3d training datasets of manually annotated nuclei center points
  are available. However, the impact on detection accuracy caused by training on such
  sparse ground truth as opposed to dense pixel-wise ground truth has not yet been
  quantified. To this end, we compare nuclei detection accuracy yielded by training
  on dense vs. sparse ground truth. Our results suggest that training on sparse ground
  truth yields competitive nuclei detection rates.
