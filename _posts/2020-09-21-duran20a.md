title: Prostate Cancer Semantic Segmentation by Gleason Score Group in bi-parametric
  MRI with Self Attention Model on the Peripheral Zone
abstract: 'In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-class attention network
  to jointly perform peripheral zone (PZ) segmentation and PZ lesions detection with
  Gleason score (GS) group grading. After encoding the information on a latent space,
  the network is separated in two branches: 1) the first branch performs PZ segmentation
  2) the second branch uses this zonal prior as an attention gate for the detection
  and grading of PZ lesions. The model was trained and validated with a 5-fold cross-validation
  on an heterogeneous series of 98 MRI exams acquired on two different scanners prior
  prostatectomy. In the free-response receiver operating characteristics (FROC) analysis
  for clinically significant lesions (defined as GS $> 6$) detection, our model achieves
  $75.8% \pm 3.4$% sensitivity at 2.5 false positive per patient. Regarding the automatic
  GS group grading, Cohenâ€™s quadratic weighted kappa coefficient is $0.35 \pm 0.05$,
  which is considered as a fair agreement and an improvement with regards to the baseline
  U-Net model. Our method achieves good performance without requiring any prior manual
  region delineation in clinical practice. We show that the addition of the attention
  mechanism improves the CAD performance in comparison to the baseline model.'
