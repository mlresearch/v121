title: Locating Cephalometric X-Ray Landmarks with Foveated Pyramid Attention
abstract: 'CNNs, initially inspired by human vision, differ in a key way: they sample
  uniformly, rather than with highest density in a focal point. For very large images,
  this makes training untenable, as the memory and computation required for activation
  maps scales quadratically with the side length of an image. We propose an image
  pyramid based approach that extracts narrow glimpses of the of the input image and
  iteratively refines them to accomplish regression tasks. To assist with high-accuracy
  regression, we introduce a novel intermediate representation we call ‘spatialized
  features’. Our approach scales logarithmically with the side length, so it works
  with very large images. We apply our method to Cephalometric X-ray Landmark Detection
  and get state-of-the-art results.'
