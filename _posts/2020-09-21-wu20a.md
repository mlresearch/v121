title: Improving the Ability of Deep Neural Networks to Use Information from Multiple
  Views in Breast Cancer Screening
abstract: In breast cancer screening, radiologists make the diagnosis based on images
  that are taken from two angles. Inspired by this, we seek to improve the performance
  of deep neural networks applied to this task by encouraging the model to use information
  from both views of the breast. First, we took a closer look at the training process
  and observed an imbalance between learning from the two views. In particular, we
  observed that layers processing one of the views have parameters with larger gradients
  in magnitude, and contribute more to the overall loss reduction. Next, we tested
  several methods targeted at utilizing both views more equally in training. We found
  that using the same weights to process both views, or using modality dropout, leads
  to a boost in performance. Looking forward, our results indicate improving learning
  dynamics as a promising avenue for improving utilization of multiple views in deep
  neural networks for medical diagnosis.
