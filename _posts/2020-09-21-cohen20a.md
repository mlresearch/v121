title: On the limits of cross-domain generalization in automated X-ray prediction
abstract: 'This large scale study focuses on quantifying what X-rays diagnostic prediction
  tasks generalize well across multiple different datasets. We present evidence that
  the issue of generalization is not due to a shift in the images but instead a shift
  in the labels. We study the cross-domain performance, agreement between models,
  and model representations. We find interesting discrepancies between performance
  and agreement where models which both achieve good performance disagree in their
  predictions as well as models which agree yet achieve poor performance. We also
  test for concept similarity by regularizing a network to group tasks across multiple
  datasets together and observe variation across the tasks. All code is made available
  online and data is publicly available: {https://github.com/mlmed/torchxrayvision}.'
