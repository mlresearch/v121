title: 'DRMIME: Differentiable Mutual Information and Matrix Exponential for Multi-Resolution
  Image Registration'
abstract: We present a novel unsupervised image registration algorithm using mutual
  information (MI). It is differentiable end-to-end and can be used for both multi-modal
  and mono-modal registration. The novelty here is that rather than using traditional
  ways of approximating MI which are often histogram based, we use a neural estimator
  called MINE and supplement it with matrix exponential for transformation matrix
  computation. The introduction of MINE tackles some of the drawbacks of histogram
  based MI computation and matrix exponential makes the optimization process smoother.
  Our use of multi-resolution objective function expedites the optimization process
  and leads to improved results as compared to the standard algorithms available out-of-the-box
  in state-of-the-art image registration toolboxes empirically demonstrated on publicly
  available datasets.
