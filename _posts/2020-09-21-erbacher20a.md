title: 'Priority U-Net: Detection of Punctuate White Matter Lesions in Preterm Neonate
  in 3D Cranial Ultrasonography'
abstract: About $18-35%$ of the preterm infants suffer from punctuate white matter
  lesion (PWML). Accurately assessing the volume and localisation of these lesions
  at the early postnatal phase can help paediatricians adapting the therapeutic strategy
  and potentially reduce severe sequelae. MRI is the gold standard neuroimaging tool
  to assess minimal to severe WM lesions, but it is only rarely performed for cost
  and accessibility reasons. Cranial ultrasonography (cUS) is a routinely used tool,
  however, the visual detection of PWM lesions is challenging and time consuming due
  to speckle noise and low contrast image. In this paper we perform semantic detection
  and segmentation of PWML on 3D cranial ultrasonography. We introduce a novel deep
  architecture, called Priority U-Net, based on the 2D U-Net backbone combined with
  the self balancing focal loss and a soft attention model focusing on the PWML localisation.
  The proposed attention mask is a 3D probabilistic map derived from spatial prior
  knowledge of PWML localisation computed from our dataset. We compare the performance
  of the priority U-Net with the U-Net baseline based on a dataset including 21 exams
  of preterm neonates (131 PWMLs). We also evaluate the impact of the self-balancing
  focal loss (SBFL) on the performance. Compared to the U-Net, the priority U-Net
  with SBFL increases the recall and the precision in the detection task from 0.4404
  to 0.5370 and from 0.3217 to 0.5043, respectively. The Dice metric is also increased
  from 0.3040 to 0.3839 in the segmentation task.
