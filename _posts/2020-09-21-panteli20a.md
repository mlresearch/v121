title: Siamese Tracking of Cell Behaviour Patterns
abstract: Tracking and segmentation of biological cells in video sequences is a challenging
  problem, especially due to the similarity of the cells and high levels of inherent
  noise. Most machine learning-based approaches lack robustness and suffer from sensitivity
  to less prominent events such as mitosis, apoptosis and cell collisions. Due to
  the large variance in medical image characteristics, most approaches are dataset-specific
  and do not generalise well on other datasets. In this paper, we propose a simple
  end-to-end cascade neural architecture that can effectively model the movement behaviour
  of biological cells and predict collision and mitosis events. Our approach uses
  U-Net for an initial segmentation which is then improved through processing by a
  siamese tracker capable of matching each cell along the temporal axis. By facilitating
  the re-segmentation of collided and mitotic cells, our method demonstrates its capability
  to handle volatile trajectories and unpredictable cell locations while being invariant
  to cell morphology. We demonstrate that our tracking approach achieves state-of-the-art
  results on PhC-C2DL-PSC and Fluo-N2DH-SIM+ datasets and ranks second on the DIC-C2DH-HeLa
  dataset of the cell tracking challenge benchmarks.
