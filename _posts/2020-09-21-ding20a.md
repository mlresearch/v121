title: Uncertainty-Aware Training of Neural Networks for Selective Medical Image Segmentation
abstract: State-of-the-art deep learning based methods have achieved remarkable performance
  on medical image segmentation. Their applications in the clinical setting are, however,
  limited due to the lack of trustworthiness and reliability. Selective image segmentation
  has been proposed to address this issue by letting a DNN model process instances
  with high confidence while referring difficult ones with high uncertainty to experienced
  radiologists. As such, the model performance is only affected by the predictions
  on the high confidence subset rather than the whole dataset. Existing selective
  segmentation methods, however, ignore this unique property of selective segmentation
  and train their DNN models by optimizing accuracy on the entire dataset. Motivated
  by such a discrepancy, we present a novel method in this paper that considers such
  uncertainty in the training process to maximize the accuracy on the confident subset
  rather than the accuracy on the whole dataset. Experimental results using the whole
  heart and great vessel segmentation and gland segmentation show that such a training
  scheme can significantly improve the performance of selective segmentation.
