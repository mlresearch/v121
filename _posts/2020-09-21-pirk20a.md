title: Deep learning-based parameter mapping for joint relaxation and diffusion tensor
  MR Fingerprinting
abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables the simultaneous quantification
  of multiple properties of biological tissues. It relies on a pseudo-random acquisition
  and the matching of acquired signal evolutions to a precomputed dictionary. However,
  the dictionary is not scalable to higher-parametric spaces, limiting MRF to the
  simultaneous mapping of only a small number of parameters (proton density, T1 and
  T2 in general). Inspired by diffusion-weighted SSFP imaging, we present a proof-of-concept
  of a novel MRF sequence with embedded diffusion-encoding gradients along all three
  axes to efficiently encode orientational diffusion and T1 and T2 relaxation. We
  take advantage of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct multiple quantitative
  maps from this single, highly undersampled acquisition. We bypass expensive dictionary
  matching by learning the implicit physical relationships between the spatiotemporal
  MRF data and the T1, T2 and diffusion tensor parameters. The predicted parameter
  maps and the derived scalar diffusion metrics agree well with state-of-the-art reference
  protocols. Orientational diffusion information is captured as seen from the estimated
  primary diffusion directions. In addition to this, the joint acquisition and reconstruction
  framework proves capable of preserving tissue abnormalities in multiple sclerosis
  lesions.
