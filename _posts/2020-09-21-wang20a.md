title: Domain adaptation model for retinopathy detection from cross-domain OCT images
abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) can assist in retinopathy screening by automatically
  classifying patients into normal and abnormal categories according to optical coherence
  tomography (OCT) images. Typically, OCT images captured from different devices show
  heterogeneous appearances because of different scan settings; thus, the DNN model
  trained from one domain may fail if applied directly to a new domain. As data labels
  are difficult to acquire, we proposed a generative adversarial network-based domain
  adaptation model to address the cross-domain OCT images classification task, which
  can extract invariant and discriminative characteristics shared by different domains
  without incurring additional labeling cost. A feature generator, a Wasserstein distance
  estimator, a domain discriminator, and a classifier were included in the model to
  enforce the extraction of domain invariant representations. We applied the model
  to OCT images as well as public digit images. Results show that the model can significantly
  improve the classification accuracy of cross-domain images.
