title: 'How Distance Transform Maps Boost Segmentation CNNs: An Empirical Study'
abstract: 'Incorporating distance transform maps of ground truth into segmentation
  CNNs has been an interesting new trend in the last year. Despite many great works
  leading to improvements on a variety of segmentation tasks, the comparison among
  these methods has not been well studied. In this paper, our {\em first contribution}
  is to summarize the latest developments of these methods in the 3D medical segmentation
  field. The {\em second contribution} is that we systematically evaluated five benchmark
  methods on two representative public datasets. These experiments highlight that
  all the five benchmark methods can bring performance gains to baseline V-Net. However,
  the implementation details have a noticeable impact on the performance, and not
  all the methods hold the benefits on different datasets. Finally, we suggest the
  best practices and indicate unsolved problems for incorporating distance transform
  maps into CNNs, which we hope would be useful for the community. The codes and trained
  models are publicly available at: {https://github.com/JunMa11/SegWithDistMap}.'
