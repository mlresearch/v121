title: Extending Unsupervised Neural Image Compression With Supervised Multitask Learning
abstract: 'We focus on the problem of training convolutional neural networks on gigapixel
  histopathology images to predict image-level targets. For this purpose, we extend
  Neural Image Compression (NIC), an image compression framework that reduces the
  dimensionality of these images using an encoder network trained unsupervisedly.
  We propose to train this encoder using supervised multitask learning (MTL) instead.
  We applied the proposed MTL NIC to two histopathology datasets and three tasks.
  First, we obtained state-of-the-art results in the Tumor Proliferation Assessment
  Challenge of 2016 (TUPAC16). Second, we successfully classified histopathological
  growth patterns in images with colorectal liver metastasis (CLM). Third, we predicted
  patient risk of death by learning directly from overall survival in the same CLM
  data. Our experimental results suggest that the representations learned by the MTL
  objective are: (1) highly specific, due to the supervised training signal, and (2)
  transferable, since the same features perform well across different tasks. Additionally,
  we trained multiple encoders with different training objectives, e.g. unsupervised
  and variants of MTL, and observed a positive correlation between the number of tasks
  in MTL and the system performance on the TUPAC16 dataset.'
