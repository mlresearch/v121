title: 'Beyond Classification: Whole Slide Tissue Histopathology Analysis By End-To-End
  Part Learning'
abstract: An emerging technology in cancer care and research is the use of histopathology
  whole slide images (WSI). Leveraging computation methods to aid in WSI assessment
  poses unique challenges. WSIs, being extremely high resolution giga-pixel images,
  cannot be directly processed by convolutional neural networks (CNN) due to huge
  computational cost. For this reason, state-of-the-art methods for WSI analysis adopt
  a two-stage approach where the training of a tile encoder is decoupled from the
  tile aggregation. This results in a trade-off between learning diverse and discriminative
  features. In contrast, we propose end-to-end part learning (EPL) which is able to
  learn diverse features while ensuring that learned features are discriminative.
  Each WSI is modeled as consisting of $k$ groups of tiles with similar features,
  defined as parts. A loss with respect to the slide label is backpropagated through
  an integrated CNN model to $k$ input tiles that are used to represent each part.
  Our experiments show that EPL is capable of clinical grade prediction of prostate
  and basal cell carcinoma. Further, we show that diverse discriminative features
  produced by EPL succeeds in multi-label classification of lung cancer architectural
  subtypes. Beyond classification, our method provides rich information of slides
  for high quality clinical decision support.
