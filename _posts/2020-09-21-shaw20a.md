title: A Heteroscedastic Uncertainty Model for Decoupling Sources of MRI Image Quality
abstract: Quality control (QC) of medical images is essential to ensure that downstream
  analyses such as segmentation can be performed successfully. Currently, QC is predominantly
  performed visually at significant time and operator cost. We aim to automate the
  process by formulating a probabilistic network that estimates uncertainty through
  a heteroscedastic noise model, hence providing a proxy measure of task-specific
  image quality that is learnt directly from the data. By augmenting the training
  data with different types of simulated k-space artefacts, we propose a novel cascading
  CNN architecture based on a student-teacher framework to decouple sources of uncertainty
  related to different k-space augmentations in an entirely self-supervised manner.
  This enables us to predict separate uncertainty quantities for the different types
  of data degradation. While the uncertainty measures reflect the presence and severity
  of image artefacts, the network also provides the segmentation predictions given
  the quality of the data. We show models trained with simulated artefacts provide
  informative measures of uncertainty on real-world images and we validate our uncertainty
  predictions on problematic images identified by human-raters.
