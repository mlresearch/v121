title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Organ Localization in CT
abstract: Robust localization of organs in computed tomography scans is a constant
  pre-processing requirement for organ-specific image retrieval, radiotherapy planning,
  and interventional image analysis. In contrast to current solutions based on exhaustive
  search or region proposals, which require large amounts of annotated data, we propose
  a deep reinforcement learning approach for organ localization in CT. In this work,
  an artificial agent is actively self-taught to localize organs in CT by learning
  from its asserts and mistakes. Within the context of reinforcement learning, we
  propose a novel set of actions tailored for organ localization in CT. Our method
  can use as a plug-and-play module for localizing any organ of interest. We evaluate
  the proposed solution on the public VISCERAL dataset containing CT scans with varying
  fields of view and multiple organs. We achieved an overall intersection over union
  of 0.63, an absolute median wall distance of 2.25 mm and a median distance between
  centroids of 3.65 mm.
