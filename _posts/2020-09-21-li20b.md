title: Generating Fundus Fluorescence Angiography Images from Structure Fundus Images
  Using Generative Adversarial Networks
abstract: Fluorescein angiography can provide a map of retinal vascular structure
  and function, which is commonly used in ophthalmology diagnosis, however, this imaging
  modality may pose risks of harm to the patients. To help physicians reduce the potential
  risks of diagnosis, an image translation method is adopted. In this work, we proposed
  a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method to directly learn
  the mapping relationship between structure fundus images and fundus fluorescence
  angiography (FFA) images. Moreover, local saliency maps, which define each pixelï¿½s
  importance, are used to define a novel saliency loss in the GAN cost function. This
  facilitates more accurate learning of small-vessel and fluorescein leakage features.
  The proposed method was validated on our dataset and the publicly available Isfahan
  MISP dataset with the metrics of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural
  similarity (SSIM). The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can
  accurately generate both retinal vascular and fluorescein leakage structures, which
  has great practical significance for clinical diagnosis and analysis.
