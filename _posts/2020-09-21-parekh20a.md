title: Multitask radiological modality invariant landmark localization using deep
  reinforcement learning
abstract: Deep learning techniques are increasingly being developed for several applications
  in radiology, for example landmark and organ localization with segmentation. However,
  these applications to date have been limited in nature, in that, they are restricted
  to just a single task e.g. localization of tumors or to a specific organ using supervised
  training by an expert. As a result, to develop a radiological decision support system,
  it would need to be equipped with potentially hundreds of deep learning models with
  each model trained for a specific task or organ. This would be both space and computationally
  expensive. In addition, the true potential of deep learning methods in radiology
  can only be achieved when the model is adaptable and generalizable to multiple different
  tasks. To that end, we have developed and implemented a multitask modality invariant
  deep reinforcement learning framework (MIDRL) for landmark localization and segmentation
  in radiological applications. MIDRL was evaluated using a diverse data set containing
  multiparametric MRIs (mpMRI) acquired from different organs and with different imaging
  parameters. A 2D single agent model was trained to localize six different anatomical
  structures throughout the body, including, knee, trochanter, heart, kidney, breast
  nipple, and prostate across T1 weighted, T2 weighted, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced
  (DCE), Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), and DIXON MRI sequences obtained from twenty-four
  breast, eight prostate, and twenty five whole body mpMRIs. Additionally, a 3D multi-agent
  model was trained to localize knee, trochanter, heart, and kidney in the whole body
  mpMRIs. The trained MIDRL framework produced excellent accuracy in localizing each
  of the anatomical landmarks. In conclusion, we developed a multitask deep reinforcement
  learning framework and demonstrated MIDRLï¿½s potential towards the development of
  a general AI for a radiological decision support system.
